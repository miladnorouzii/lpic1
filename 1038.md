The need to learn how to use text editors in Linux is indisputable. Every system administrator and engineer deal with configuration (plain text) files on a daily basis, and most times this is done purely using one or more tools from a command-line interface (such as **nano**, **vi**, or **emacs**).

### vi

The vi editor (visual editor) is almost certainly on every Linux and UNIX system. In fact, if a system has just one editor, it’s probably vi, so it’s worth knowing your way around in vi.

Using vi editor, we can edit an existing file or create a new file from scratch. we can also use this editor to just read a text file.

> vi editor is great even trough ssh sessions!

#### vi or vim ?

 Most Linux distributions now ship with the vim (for **V**i **IM**proved) editor rather than classic vi. Vim is upward compatible with vi and has a graphical mode available (gvim) as well as the standard vi text mode interface. The `vi` command is usually an alias or symbolic link to the vim program.

 There are several versions of vim: tiny, small, normal, big, and huge. We can find out what version of vim we are running and what features are included by using the command(ubuntu 16.04 here ):

Inorder to read, create or modify a file with vi, give the file name to it:

```
vi filename
```

Okey lets start learning vi(m):

### vi modes

Vim actually has three modes: **insert mode**, **command mode**, and **escape** ** (last-line) mode**. Let’s start with the default mode you’ll see when you start up Vim–command mode.

* **command mode** :  When you run vim filename to edit a file, Vim starts out in command mode. This means that all the alphanumeric keys are bound to commands, rather than inserting those characters.(save, quit, search/replace, navigate around, execute macros,...)
* **insert mode** :  _To enter the insert mode, type i (for “insert”)_ and now the keys will behave as you’d expect. You can type normally until you want to make a correction, save the file, or perform another operation that’s reserved for command mode or escape (last-line) mode. _To get out of insert mode, hit the Escape key._
* **escape (last-line) mode** :  Once you press Escape, you’re in command mode again. What if you’d like to save your file or search through your document? No problem, _press : and Vim will switch to escape (last-line) mode_. Vim is now waiting for you to enter a command like :w to write the file or :q to exit the editor.
If that all sounds complicated, it’s really not. It does take a few days to start training your brain to move between the modes and memorizing the most important keys for movement, commands, and so on.

####  Moving the cursor 

The first thing you’ll want to learn is how to move around a file. When you’re in command mode, you’ll want to remember the following keys and what they do:

| Key    | function                                                       |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| h      | Move left one character on the current line                    |
| j      | Move down to the next line                                     |
| k      | Move up to the previous line                                   |
| l      | Move right one character on the current line                   |
| w      | Move to the next word on the current line                      |
| e      | Move to the next end of word on the current line               |
| b      | Move to the previous beginning of the word on the current line |
| Crtl-f | Scroll forward one page                                        |
| Ctrl-b |  Scroll backward one page                                      |

>  If you type a number before any of these commands, then the command will be executed that many times. This number is called a _repetition count_ or simply _count_. For example, 5h will move left five characters. You can use repetition counts with many vi commands.

Press ESC to return back to the normal command mode!

> When you want to write and exit from a file consider  you permissions, the bellow command write out the current file using sudo:
>
> :w !sudo tee % 
>
> * :w – Write a file (actually buffer). 
> * !sudo – Call shell with sudo command. 
> * tee – The output of write (vim :w) command redirected using tee. 
> * % – The % is nothing but current file name.

### tab and window

| :e! | it will discard local changes and reload.          |

{% hint style="success" %}
### VIM Tip : running external commands in a shell

It usuaslly happens that we need to run a command in shell to see the result of file which we are edditing. It could be happened in two ways:

1.We could suspend your session (ctrl-Z), and then run the command in your shell.That’s a lot of keystrokes, though !

2.So, instead, you could use vim’s built-in “run a shell command”:

> :!cmd Run a shell command, shows you the output and prompts you before returning to your current buffer.
{% endhint %}

### help

Need help? you can use `:help` or` :help keyword`  and vim will open help for keyword.
